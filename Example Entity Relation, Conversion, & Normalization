Entity
Attributes
Crisis Site
Sitecountry, siteNum(key), crisisType, crisisLvl, crisisStart, estAreaSize, est#Dead, est#Patients, estCost, arriveTime
Nearest [DWBHQ]
HQcountry, siteNum(key), distance, alertReceivedTime, phone#, emailAdd.
currentMeasures 
PrevEd, Triage, Council, OutReach, siteNum(key)

Relationship:
Nearest [DWBHQ]:Crisis Site is a one-to-one relationship. The Crisis Site entity is the owner entity, so when we do the ER-to-relational conversion, the key of the Crisis Site entity (siteNum) will help identify the Nearest [DWBHQ]. Participation on both sides is mandatory.
Crisis Site:currentMeasures is a one-to-numerous relationship. The Crisis Site entity is the owner entity, so when we do the ER-to-relational conversion, the key of the Crisis Site entity (siteNum) will help identify the which Measures need to be taken. Participation of Crisis Site is mandatory, however participation of Measures is optional since not all measures must be taken.





Entity-Relationship to Relational conversion

1)Tables would initially include, Crisis Site, currentMeasures, and Nearest[DWBHQ]
2)There are two relationships, Crisis Site:currentMeasures and Crisis Site:Nearest[DWBHQ], both relationships will be handled by putting the key of Crisis Site in currentMeasures and Nearest[DWBHQ] as both the primary key and a foreign key.
3)There are no multivalued attributes.
4)Crisis Site: siteNum(PK), Sitecountry, crisisType, crisisLvl, crisisStart, estAreaSize,			 est#Dead, est#Patients, estCost, arriveTime
  Measures: siteNum(PFK), PrevEd, Triage, Council, OutReach
  Nearest[DWBHQ]: siteNum(PFK), HQcountry, distance, alertReceivedTime, phone#, 			email address


Normalization

The (preliminary) attributes are siteNum, Sitecountry, HQcountry, crisisType, crisisLvl, crisisStart, estAreaSize, est#Dead, est#Patients, estCost, alertRecievedTime, arriveTime, distance, phone#, emailAdd, PrevEd, Triage, Council, OutReach.

{siteNum} → {Sitecountry, crisisType, crisisLvl, crisisStart, arriveTime, estAreaSize, est#Dead, est#Patients, estCost}

	{siteNum} → {HQcountry, distance, alertRecievedTime}

	{siteNum} → {PrevEd, Triage, Council, OutReach}

	{HQcountry} → {phone#, emailAdd}

	{crisisType, crisisLvl, Sitecountry, crisisStart} → {PrevEd, Triage, Council, OutReach}
 
{crisisStart, crisisType, crisisLvl} → {estAreaSize, est#Dead, est#Patients, estCost}

{alertRecievedTime, distance} → {arriveTime}


Combine siteNum dependencies into one table
	{siteNum, Sitecountry, crisisType, crisisLvl, crisisStart, arriveTime, estAreaSize, est#Dead, est#Patients, estCost, HQcountry, distance, alertRecievedTime, PrevEd, Triage, Council, OutReach} with key of siteNum.
	then ignore dependent attributes already listed
	so,
	{HQcounrty, phone#, emailAdd} are a table with key of HQcountry.
